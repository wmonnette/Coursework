This app calculates how much to feed your dog based on your dog's weight.
Users select their dog's weight with the picker wheel and the UI text field
below will display how many cups of food to feed your dog per day.

This app is simplistic, but I only had one day, as my original final idea
was too ambitious I and would not finish in time for the deadline. Please
confer with Dr. Chapman about the change in plans, as he approved This
change.
